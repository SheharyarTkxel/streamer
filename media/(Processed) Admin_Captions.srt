3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,733
In this video we’ll show you how easy it is for you to configure Streamer™ 

4
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,799
to provide captioning, note-taking and translation services 

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,700
for your teachers, staff and students. 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,100
First, I’ll give you an overview of Streamer, 

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,733
then I’ll show you how to assign rooms to staff and students, 

8
00:00:25,733 --> 00:00:28,499
how create user accounts for these individuals, 

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,660
and we’ll wrap things up with a series of user tips. 

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,199
Let’s get started.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,400
With your school’s subscription we created an overall admin account 

12
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,366
that you will use to manage all the Streamer™ rooms and accounts in your district. 

13
00:00:40,366 --> 00:00:44,766
This is a very powerful account. It has access to every room in the district. 

14
00:00:44,766 --> 00:00:49,532
You can monitor everyone’s usage, allocate and take away rooms and usage permissions, 

15
00:00:49,533 --> 00:00:52,966
and you can do this from any location at any time. 

16
00:00:52,966 --> 00:00:56,666
This is not an account you want to give to teachers or students - keep it private. 

17
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:59,866
You can create duplicate admin accounts, 

18
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:04,499
such as an admin account that just the staff at a middle school building will use to manage their accounts,  

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,660
but keep this main account to yourself, as it has full permissions 

20
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,766
and unlike every other account on your system, 

21
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:14,932
the permissions from the main admin account can never be revoked. 

22
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:18,133
To log into Streamer™, open a Chrome browser 

23
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:21,433
and go to www.streamer.center. 

24
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:25,990
Click the Login button and enter your account. 

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,900
If you do not have one, contact Auditory Sciences using this contact information. 

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,700
After you accept the terms and conditions 

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,660
you will be placed in your school district’s Streamer Lobby. 

28
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,866
This is where you see all your district’s rooms along with their names, 

29
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:44,999
if they are currently being used, and if so by how many people. 

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,266
By default, the rooms in use are shown first. 

31
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:52,899
A Streamer™ room is where the captioning for a conversation or classroom lecture appears. 

32
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:57,400
The teachers and students enter the room using an account you will create for them. 

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,666
When they are in the room everything they say is captioned and displayed. 

34
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:05,299
If you need more rooms added to your Lobby, just let us know. 

35
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:10,000
With each new subscription to Streamer, we will add an additional room to your lobby. 

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,233
You will notice that each room has a number, just like the physical rooms in your school buildings also have numbers, 

37
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,299
something like Room 105. 

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,700
And each Streamer™ room also has a label, 

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,133
just like a teacher places their name on the door to their school room. 

40
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:30,899
The number gives you a way to track rooms, 

41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,000
and the label tells you who has currently been assigned that specific room. 

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,133
You can assign Streamer™ rooms using any approach you want. 

43
00:02:38,133 --> 00:02:42,266
However, most schools assign a Streamer room to each student that has 

44
00:02:42,266 --> 00:02:45,999
requested captioning, note-taking or translation services. 

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,966
Again, the Streamer™ rooms are typically assigned to a  student versus the teacher. 

46
00:02:50,966 --> 00:02:55,990
To assign a room to a student, you enter that room by clicking on it. 

47
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,333
Then type forward slash topic followed by the name of the person that will be using the room. 

48
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:04,299
In this case, let’s say it is a student named Jessica Parsons. 

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:13,266
There, the label has been created. 

50
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:17,832
It is shown here, 

51
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:22,633
and when I go back out to the Lobby, the room now has Jessica’s name listed. 

52
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:28,266
Next, we need to create a User Account for Jessica and give her permission to use her room. 

53
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:31,466
You could exit Chrome and then create the account, 

54
00:03:31,466 --> 00:03:35,332
but as a shortcut, I like creating accounts by using a different browser. 

55
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:40,330
That way I do not have to keep logging out and logging back into my admin account. 

56
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,699
So I’ll open up a new window using a browser other than Chrome, 

57
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:50,500
go to www.streamer.center, click Login and then the “Create One” option. 

58
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,433
I’ll enter the new account name. 

59
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:57,799
It cannot have any spaces, so I’ll use firstname.lastname for the format. 

60
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,000
The email is only used if the student forgets their password and it needs to be reset. 

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,800
If you leave the language settings blank, they default to American English. 

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,966
The preferred voice is used for a student that is non-verbal and also if you are planning to have 

63
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:16,799
Streamer generate spoken translations of your conversations. 

64
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,100
If you leave it blank it simply defaults to an adult male voice. 

65
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,133
And the password needs to be at least eight characters long. 

66
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:32,366
There, we’ve now created the account. 

67
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:37,566
Notice that in her Lobby she does not have access to her room. 

68
00:04:37,566 --> 00:04:39,666
We’ll do that now. 

69
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,232
I’ll go back to my admin account here in the Chrome browser, 

70
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,166
jump into the room we’ve assigned to Jessica, 

71
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:50,466
and I will give her permission to use that room by using the /allow @user command. 

72
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:57,466
Note that commands always start with the forward slash symbol, and user accounts always start with the @ symbol. 

73
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:01,866
Also notice that there is a space between the command and command parameters. 

74
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:06,732
Now that I’ve allowed Jessica to use the room, you can see it appears in her Lobby. 

75
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:11,533
There are several other permissions you may want to give a student: 

76
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:18,633
/Setdownload and /setclear sets the ability for the user to download and clear the transcript. 

77
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:22,799
The /addowner command gives the student the complete set of permissions. 

78
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,600
If they are an owner of the room, they can download and clear transcripts 

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,166
and they can invite others to join them into the room, as well as kick people out. 

80
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:35,132
To revoke that permission, use the removeowner command, 

81
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:40,899
and to see a complete listing of owners, use the /owners command. 

82
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,700


83
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:50,433
/makenormal removes the ability for the student to add to the transcripts, 

84
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,733
they can only view the transcript.  

85
00:05:54,733 --> 00:06:01,660


86
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,666
/makesuper gives that ability back to the student. 

87
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:10,266
We’ve already shown you the /allow command, 

88
00:06:10,266 --> 00:06:12,632
which gives a student permission to use a room. 

89
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:14,999
The /unallow command removes that permission 

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,660
and the /allowed command shows you the entire list of users that can access the room. 

91
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,499
The /welcome command sets a welcome message that a student will see 

92
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,166
each time the log into their room at the start of the day. 

93
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:31,532
For a complete set of commands, click on the question mark in the 

94
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:37,166
upper right corner of the interface, or you can print a copy of these commands by using this address. 

95
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:42,799


96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:48,660
Next you will want to repeat this process for each teacher that will be using the student’s room. 

97
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,732
So if Jessica has six teachers, then you will repeat this process six times. 

98
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:59,133
Let’s make one for one of Jessica’s teachers, Ms.Peterson.

[♫♫ - lively music playing] 

100
00:07:26,133 --> 00:07:28,899
There, once you’ve done it a few times, 

101
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:32,800
creating each account and assigning permissions only takes about 30 seconds, 

102
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,133
so it goes fast. 

103
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:38,433
Here are some user tips to make it go faster. 

104
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,733
You will be using the same set of about eight commands pretty often: 

105
00:07:41,733 --> 00:07:49,466
the /allow, /allowed, /addowner, /owners, setdownload, /setclear, /topic and /welcome commands. 

106
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:52,866
So it’s suggested you create shortcuts for these commands. 

107
00:07:52,866 --> 00:08:02,366
To do that click on the Account Settings icon, and then the Phrases tab. 

108
00:08:02,366 --> 00:08:06,299
This top line is the label that will be displayed in your right side-panel. 

109
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,533
Pick a short label, just a couple of words at most. 

110
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,866
I tend to use the actual command, such as forward slash allow. 

111
00:08:13,866 --> 00:08:17,232
The Phrase is the actual command that will be entered, 

112
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:22,799
so in this case I’ll type /allow, then the space, then the @ symbol.  

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,733
I like using the color black for all my commands, because that way the shortcuts are located at the top of my side panel. 

114
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:33,999
Now, when I close this tab and go back to my transcript window, 

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,933
you see the new command shortcut. 

116
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:42,499
If it was a command without a parameter I’d just double-click it. 

117
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,200
Since the /allow command requires a parameter, I’ll single click, 

118
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:52,166
enter the user account, and then the enter key. 

119
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,899


120
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,733
Another nice shortcut for commands that you are repeating is the up arrow on your keyboard. 

121
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:04,433
Streamer remembers all the commands you have recently entered 

122
00:09:04,433 --> 00:09:06,199
in the order in which you entered them. 

123
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,333
This is really nice if you are configuring say a dozen rooms and you are repeating a lot of 

124
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:15,666
/allow and /setdownload commands. 

125
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:18,660
And up here is the Quick Access Bar. 

126
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,532
If you are making changes to a lot of rooms, 

127
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:24,266
open them all up at once and you will see them listed here. 

128
00:09:24,266 --> 00:09:30,166
Enter the first room, make the changes, and  jump to the next room by clicking on the Tab key. 

129
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:34,799
The combination of the Tab key and up arrow makes it easy to quickly edit 

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,733
a large number or rooms, for example if you are changing the welcome message for every room. 

131
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:45,199
And one more. If you want to send a message to every Streamer™ user in your district, 

132
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,600
use the /broadcast command. 

133
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,833
Type /broadcast followed by your message. 

134
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:55,990
It will be sent to every room and every user in your district. 

135
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,700
Here are a few more User Tips: 

136
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,933
The side panel on the right shows you who has joined your room. 

137
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:09,533
You can share documents with your teachers by dragging and dropping them into the transcript window, 

138
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:18,499
or to specific users by specifying their user account name before you click the send button. 

139
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,366
You can send messages by typing the @ symbol into the command bar 

140
00:10:22,366 --> 00:10:27,499
followed by their user account name and the message, this this. 

141
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:32,833
There, that message will pop up on the person’s computer. 

142
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:38,699
You can clear the contents of the transcript by typing /clear into the command bar. 

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,330
Per our privacy policy, there is no undo command, 

144
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:48,990
so when you clear the transcript, it is gone from everyone’s Streamer™ window and it is gone forever. 

145
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,866
That’s it for this video. Thanks for watching.
